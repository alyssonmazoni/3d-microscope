In that step, one must find a pixel of a reference object, of known shape and color, whose appearance under m different illumination fields is similar to that of a given scene pixel. This search reduces to finding the closest match to a given m-vector in a table with a thousand or more m-vectors. Our method is faster than previously known solutions for this problem but, unlike some of them, is exact, i.e., always yields the best matching entry in the table, and does not assume point-like sources. Our solution exploits the fact that the table is in fact a fairly flat 2-D manifold in m-dimensional space so that the search can be efficiently solved with a uniform 2-D grid structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {The application of a disturbance observer (DOB) and a variable structure controller (VSC) to current control of microstepping for permanent-magnet stepper motors (PMSMs) is studied. This is a recent approach to the current regulation of PMSM that results in improvement of position tracking performance of microstepping using only current feedback. We designed the DOB to estimate back electromotive force (EMF) in the form of a high-pass filter. Since the PMSM is a two-input one-output minimum-phase nonlinear system, the asymptotic convergence of the currents to the desired currents guarantees the asymptotic convergence of the position to the desired position in microstepping. Therefore, in order to compensate for the estimation errors of back EMFs and to guarantee the desired currents required for microstepping, the VSC is designed with a state feedback controller. The current tracking error and the integral of the current tracking error are proven to asymptotically converge to zero. Since the proposed method does not require any transformations or the calculation of sinusoidal terms, its structure is simple. The least lower bound of the absolute steady-state position tracking error during a constant-velocity period is estimated in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. Our experimental results validate the performance of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {There are many uncertainties and disturbances in the real dynamic system of a spherical stepper motor that make traditional control methods with lower precision, such as uncertain changes of magnetic field, load, and friction that generate speed ripple and deteriorate the 3-D tracking performance of the spherical motor system. In this paper, an available method is proposed to solve them by using neural networks (NNs) and a robust control scheme for improving the performance. First, a simplified torque calculation model based on finite-element method results can guarantee quick prediction of electromagnetic torque with lower error. Thus, the system model considering the friction, load, and disturbances is developed. Second, a robust NN (RNN) control scheme is presented to eliminate uncertainties to improve the tracking robust stability and overcome the undesired influence of uncertainties based on the nonlinear system dynamic model under continuous-trajectory tracking mode. Finally, as an example, the step-response and continuous-tracking processes of the motor using an RNN controller are simulated, and experiments, including the tracking using RNN proportional-differential control, are carried out to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control scheme. The simulation and experimental results of the proposed control scheme on the spherical stepper motor system demonstrate the effectiveness on satisfactory tracking performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Once a hologram is captured from the portable setup, a 3D reconstructed height profile of the cell is created. We extract several morphological cell features from the reconstructed 3D height profiles, including mean physical cell thickness, coefficient of variation, optical volume (OV) of the cell, projected area of the cell (PA), ratio of PA to OV, cell thickness kurtosis, cell thickness skewness, and the dry mass of the cell for identification using the random forest (RF) classifier. The 3D printed prototype can serve as a low-cost alternative for the developing world, where access to laboratory facilities for disease diagnosis are limited. Additionally, a cell phone sensor is used to capture the digital holograms. This enables the user to send the acquired holograms over the internet to a computational device located remotely for cellular identification and classification (analysis). The 3D printed system presented in this paper can be used as a low-cost, stable, and field-portable digital holographic microscope as well as an automated cell identification system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research paper presenting automatic cell identification using a low-cost 3D printed digital holographic microscopy setup based on common path shearing interferometry.},

abstract = {Open communication is an exigent need for future power systems, where time delay is unavoidable. In order to secure the stability of the grid, the frequency must remain within its limited range which is achieved through the load frequency control. Load frequency control signals are transmitted through communication networks which induce time delays that could destabilize power systems. So, in order to guarantee stability, the delay margin should be computed. In this paper, we present a new method for calculating the delay margin in load frequency control systems. The transcendental time delay characteristics equation is transformed into a frequency dependent equation. The spectral radius was used to find the frequencies at which the root crosses the imaginary axis. The crossing frequencies were determined through the sweeping test and the binary iteration algorithm. A one-area load frequency control system was chosen as a case study. The effectiveness of the proposed method was proven through comparison with the most recent published methods. The method shows its merit with less conservativeness and less computations. The impact of the proportional integral (PI) controller gains on the delay margin was investigated. It was found that increasing the PI controller gains reduces the delay margin.},

The field of automated microscopy has continued to be a challenge in accessibility due the expense and inflexible, noninterchangeable stages. This paper presents a low-cost, open-source microscope 3-D stage. A RepRap 3-D printer was converted to an optical microscope equipped with a customized, 3-D printed holder for a USB microscope. Precision measurements were determined to have an average error of 10 $\mu$m at the maximum speed and 27 $\mu$m at the minimum recorded speed. Accuracy tests yielded an error of 0.15{\%}. The machine is a true 3-D stage and thus able to operate with USB microscopes or conventional desktop microscopes. It is larger than all commercial alternatives, and is thus capable of high-depth images over unprecedented areas and complex geometries. The repeatability is below 2-D microscope stages, but testing shows that it is adequate for the majority of scientific applications. The open-source microscope stage costs less than 3–9{\%} of the closest proprietary commercial stages. This extreme affordability vastly improves accessibility for 3-D microscopy throughout the world.},

Commutation schemes implementing field-oriented control (FOC) and field weakening control (FWC) are developed to construct the desired current profile for torque generation without the use of direct-quadrature (DQ) transformation. The nonlinear controller is developed to guarantee the desired currents derived by the commutation scheme. Our study details the design of FOC and FWC methods based on a two-phase frame without DQ transformation.

To demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the approach, a number of examples are given, including a small trilobite ({\~{}}0.04 m), a large mounted elephant skeleton ({\~{}}3 m), and a very large fossil tree root system ({\~{}}6 m), illustrating that the method is equally applicable to specimens or even outcrops of all sizes. The digital files of the models produced in this paper are included. The results demonstrate that production of digital models from specimens for research or archival purposes is available to anyone, and it is hoped that an increased use of digitisation techniques will facilitate research and encourage collaboration and dissemination of digital data. {\textcopyright} Palaeontological Association February 2012.},

abstract = {In this paper, a TakagiSugenoKang-type self-organizing recurrent-neural- fuzzy network (T-SORNFN) is proposed for the trajectory tracking control of linear microstepping motor (LMSM) drives. Without a priori knowledge, the T-SORNFN is constructed to model the inverse dynamics of a LMSM drive by a set of recurrent fuzzy rules built online through concurrent structure and parameter learning. The fuzzy rules in the T-SORNFN can be either generated or eliminated to obtain a suitable-sized network structure, and a recursive recurrent learning laws of network parameters are derived based on the supervised gradient-descent method to achieve fast-learning converge. Based on the Lyapunov stability approach, the convergence of the T-SORNFN is guaranteed by choosing varied learning rates. Furthermore, an inverse-control architecture that incorporates T-SORNFN and a proportionalderivative controller is used to control the LMSM drive in a changing environment. A recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm is utilized for online fine-tuning the consequent parameters in T-SORNFN to obtain a more precision model. Simulated and experimental results of a LMSM drive are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed T-SORNFN control system, and its superiority is validated in comparison with NFN and RNFN control systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

Photometric stereo is an independent technique to recover the third dimension of an opaque object, given several images taken from the same viewpoint with different illumination conditions. We describe here the synergistic combination of both techniques to obtain accurate three-dimensional images of microscopic objects. In order to streamline the acquisition of the necessary images, we developed a low-cost positioner that automatically varies the microscope-to-object distance and the light direction, under control of an ARDUINO microcontroller. The main structural parts of the support were manufactured by a 3D printer. The technique and support are demonstrated with a low cost digital microscope.},

abstract = {Optical microscopy is a simple, yet essential, imaging technology. Conventional laboratory-grade optical microscopes are bulky and costly, confining their use to within laboratory settings and restricting their accessibility in regions of limited resources. With the aim of overcoming these limitations, we have realized a portable, low-cost, and highly automated optical microscope that integrates mass-manufactured components, including light-emitting diodes, a web camera, optical disk drives, and a microcontroller. Our implementation is capable of bright-field and fluorescence imaging with micrometer-scale resolution and controlled mechanical actuation of both the lens and sample. We interface the lighting, image capture , and mechanical actuators of the microscope into a single software environment, enabling automation of common microscope operations, such as image focusing and large-area sample visualization. Combination of mechanical actuation and software automation into a compact, low-cost microscope system is an important initial step toward the goal of making optical microscopy universally accessible, portable, and easy to use. Optical microscopy is a centuries-old imaging technology that is now indispensable for a wide range of fields, including medical diagnostics, biological sciences, and materials research. The basic components of an optical microscope include a light source, a series of lenses, a mechanical stage to hold and move a sample, and viewing ports, either for direct visual inspection through an eyepiece or image capture using a camera. Conventional laboratory-grade microscopes also incorporate a large support base, a precision mechanical stage with a wide range of motion, and a turret of high-end objective lenses to permit variable magnification. These additional features enable versatile, high-quality imaging in a stable environment, but also yield microscope systems that are bulky and costly. Lack of portability confines their use to within centralized laboratories and high cost limits their accessibility in areas of limited resources, such as rural regions or developing countries. One way to realize low-cost and portable microscope systems is to use inexpensive light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and lenses in a streamlined, simplistic design that enables basic sample visualization by a user [1-3]. With the wide availability of cameras integrated onto cell phones, it is also possible to build compact microscopes directly on mobile devices. This was first demonstrated by attaching a large objective lens and LEDs onto a cell phone camera, which was then used to perform bright-field and fluorescence imaging of microbacterial samples [4]. Lens-free computational microscopy, an imaging technique capable of micrometer-scale resolution over a wide, millimeter-scale field of view (FOV), has also been shown to be amenable to low-cost, portable architec-tures and has been implemented both on a cell phone [5-7] and as a stand-alone field-portable unit [8,9]. A common feature of microscope implementations that strive for low-cost and portability is the absence of a precision mechanical stage, meaning that a user must manually position a sample both along the ax-ial direction to obtain a focused image and in the transverse plane to find a region of interest.

Our method allows for uncertain or missing samples, which are often present in experimentally measured gradient maps; for sharp discontinuities in the scene's depth, e.g. along object silhouette edges; and for irregularly spaced sampling points. To accommodate these features of the problem, we use an original and flexible representation of slope data, the weight-delta mesh. Like other state of the art solutions, our algorithm reduces the problem to a system of linear equations that is solved by Gauss-Seidel iteration with multi-scale acceleration. Its novel key step is a mesh decimation procedure that preserves the connectivity of the initial mesh. Tests with various synthetic and measured gradient data show that our algorithm is as accurate and efficient as the best available integrators for uniformly sampled data. Moreover our algorithm remains accurate and efficient even for large sets of weakly-connected instances of the problem, which cannot be efficiently handled by any existing algorithm.},

We also describe several integration methods from the literature that are commonly used for this task. Based on theoretical analysis and tests with various synthetic and measured gradient maps, we argue that our algorithm is as accurate as the best existing methods, handling incomplete data and discontinuities, and is more efficient in time and memory usage, especially for large gradient maps. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Recent progress in intracellular calcium sensors and other fluorophores has promoted the widespread adoption of functional optical imaging in the life sciences. Home-built multiphoton microscopes are easy to build, highly customizable, and cost effective. For many imaging applications a 3-axis motorized stage is critical, but commercially available motorization hardware (motorized translators, controller boxes, etc) are often very expensive. Furthermore, the firmware on commercial motor controllers cannot easily be altered and is not usually designed with a microscope stage in mind. Here we describe an open-source motorization solution that is simple to construct, yet far cheaper and more customizable than commercial offerings. The cost of the controller and motorization hardware are under {\$}1000. Hardware costs are kept low by replacing linear actuators with high quality stepper motors. Electronics are assembled from commonly available hobby components, which are easy to work with. Here we describe assembly of the system and quantify the positioning accuracy of all three axes. We obtain positioning repeatability of the order of 1 \mum in X/Y and 0.1 \mum in Z. A hand-held control-pad allows the user to direct stagemotion precisely over a wide range of speeds (10 -1 to 102 \mum{\textperiodcentered}s-1), rapidly store and return to different locations, and execute "jumps" of a fixed size. In addition, the system can be controlled from a PC serial port. Our "OpenStage" controller is sufficiently flexible that it could be used to drive other devices, such as micro-manipulators, with minimal modifications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Campbell et al.},
